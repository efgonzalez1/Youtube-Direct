Youtube-Direct
==============

Automatically changes Youtube links on any webpage to point to directly to the video, instead of the page with comments, suggestions, etc.

Setup
=====
1. Download all the files
2. In Chrome goto:    Tools  >  Extensions
3. Click 'Load unpacked extension...'
4. Choose the folder with all the files
5. Chrome should load and enable the extension automatically
6. Otherwise, check off 'Enabled'
7. That's it!

Usage
=====
You will notice that Youtube links now look something like:
http://www.youtube.com/v/XXXXXXXXXXX
This takes you directly to the video which takes up your entire page. [Try out this link for an example]
Links within the video like the title will take you to the standard Youtube page with the description, comments, etc.
Also, as an added bonus, this direct video link will bypass any age restrictions so you don't need to be signed in to verify your age.
